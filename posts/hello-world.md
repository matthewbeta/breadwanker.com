The Corona Virus has locked us all in our homes and for me personally has meant a temporary break from work. 

As of next Monday I will be the kids new teacher, Mr Jackson. Until then, I have an inordinate amount of time on my hands. To ward of boredom/insanity I have replaced time with flour.

I've liked ~~baking~~ eating bread for most of my life, to be honest. I've been able to make a passable loaf for a few years, but since the kids came along, its quite tricky, to find the time, space or motivation to bake. Cabin fever, has changed that.

A friend recently shared his guide to baking sourdough, and there were a few tricks and things I'd not seen before. The most interesting was baking the bread inside a cast iron pot, which is meant to improve the crust. The results were pretty good:

I tried again a few days later and it was again a nice loaf. This time the lid of the casserole pan fell on to the loaf as I put it in the oven so it was a bit stunted on one side. Still the best crumb and crust I've ever managed.

Finally for the week, I attempted a small loaf and some rolls. This was born out of impatience. I needed bread for lunch and wouldn't have time to let a loaf cool before cutting it. I figured rolls would probably be fine warm (at least I have eaten plenty that were). These looked (and tasted) lush.

I am now enjoying making (and eating) bread. Buoyed by these recent successes, I've also successfully created my own sourdough starter which I will write about in a future post.

TTFN.
