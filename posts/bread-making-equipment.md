This is a list of stuff that I find either essential or useful for baking bread.

## Essentials

### Scraper
This is like a robot hand that doesn‚Äôt get sticky. The only actual ‚Äúbread making‚Äù thing on the essential list. I have a [metal one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0824Z7GJ4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_WhBTEb2FJ414C) and some [rubber silicone ones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00VHTD50K/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_iiBTEbKVJA9DB). I also have some silicone spatulas. 

### Scales
Scales are obviously important for weighing flour and stuff. It‚Äôs generally considered best to weigh your water too (it‚Äôs more accurate than a measuring jug) We don‚Äôt have anything special or super accurate ‚Äì just some cheap digital ones. I don‚Äôt think you need anything crazy. Although more accurate is probably better. 

### Something to keep a starter in
I keep mine in the fridge in either a Kilner jar (good because you can see how bubbly it is, and how much it‚Äôs grown) or a [plastic soup mug Tupperware thing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B005D6Y1OM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_QnvTEbCJZWGG5). This is good because you can vent the lid (to let the carbon dioxide out). My dream would be a see-through one of those. 

Dream is a bit strong tbh. I think any container with an air tight lid is fine. 

### something to proof your dough in
A bowl is good for the ‚Äúbulk fermentation‚Äù (first proof). I use a flat Pyrex oven dish because it‚Äôs a nice shape for stretch and folding the dough. Also ours has a nice plastic lid, which means I don‚Äôt need to use cling film and kill a turtle. 

For the final shaping and proof, I think you can use a colander or something with a tea towel inside it. I can‚Äôt really give advice on this as I‚Äôm well posh and have a special basket (more later). 

### Baking paper
I use this to get my dough out of the proving basket and into the Dutch oven. Not sure how I would manage this with out it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd wait her destroy the shaped dough or horribly burn my hands or both. You bake straight into a baking sheet, I guess you could turn it out of the proving thing and onto that directly. Essential for me though. 

## Nice to haves 

### Stand Mixer
(Note: I am aware the next few sentences require a heavy privilege check) Needing by hand is important to get a feel
For the dough blah blah blah. Fine but (and I can‚Äôt stress this enough) Fuck. That. Sticky hands are well annoying and kneading is a pain in the arse. We bought a [kenwood mixer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0725FZD9M/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_djvTEb0ZAAQCD) about 8 years ago and it‚Äôs great. Kitchenaid ones are very popular too I understand. It‚Äôs not necessary to have one of these but it does make things a lot quicker and easier. And your dough will have no idea. 

### Proving basket/Banetton 
As promised. [These](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01CG4P9Q2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_6mvTEb87CJPT5) are pretty cheap and, not only make for a great vessel to prove your shaped dough, they look cool and make you look like you know what you‚Äôre doing. They also leave a pretty ring pattern around your loaf. 

I recently bought a shower cap to put over mine in the fridge, again to stop me using cling film. I‚Äôve also had some success using (clean) food recycling bags (free off the council and biodegradable. You can even use them for food waste when you‚Äòre done). 

### Dutch oven
Baking inside a heavy cast iron casserole pan was a game changer for me. It really makes for an improved crust. We already had a knock-off [Le Crueset one like this](https://www.lecreuset.co.uk/signature-cast-iron-oval-casserole) which I‚Äôve been using. 

Basically you drop your shaped, scored loaf inside a red hot pan, drop the lid on and put it in the oven for 15-25 mins. Then take it off to finish the bake. 

I put mine in the oven when I turn it on to make sure it‚Äôs really hot when I come to use it. I usually splash a bit of water on the inside of the lid (which turns instantly to steam). Not only is this cool, it saves me needing to buy a squirty water thingy. 

### Lame
This is a posh thing to score the top of the bread. I only recently bought a [proper one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07YQNXQY4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_WdvTEbP410AEE). I‚Äôve been using a sharp serrated knife until now, which is a good replacement. Having a real one with a razor blade on is definitely easier (although I did cut my hand the second time I used it and bled all over the loaf üò¨). 

## Wrapping up
I‚Äôd be interested to hear of any other gadgets I can get to make my bread better or easier. If anyone has any thoughts slide into my DMs on insta (@breadwanker).
