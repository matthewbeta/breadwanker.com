A thing that the bread need community seem to be into is measuring ingredients as a percentage. This is called bakers percentages. 

## Bakers percentages?

This is just a way of measuring ingredients relative to the amount of flour you are using. For example, a basic loaf recipe might have the following ingredients:

- 500g Flour 
- 325g (ml) Water
- 7g Yeast
- 10g Salt

In that example, the percentages would be:

- 100% flour
- 65% water
- 1.4% yeast
- 2% salt. 

## Why use them?

As best I can tell, it serves 2 purposes. 

The first is to allow a baker to scale recipes up (day for making a lot of dough in a real bakery) or down (say if you only have 300g of flour but still want to make a loaf). 

The second is so you can tweak the *hydration* level (wetness) of the dough. 

## Hydration

The hydration level of your dough is the percentage of water. The dough in the basic recipe above would be 65% hydration. 

Most Sourdough recipes I have found are a lot wetter—around 75-80% hydration. Example:

- 500g flour
- 185g starter (92.5g each flour/water)
- 365g water
- 12g salt

The percentages here are:

- 100% flour (592.5g including starter)
- 77.2% water (457.5g including starter)
- 2%(ish) salt

Making this dough 77% hydration. 

Sourdough is (I’ve found) a *lot* stickier than regular dough and this is why. This is the nature of the beast. I have seen a few tips for beginners to reduce the hydration levels to around 65-70% to make it easier to handle[^caveat]. Your mileage may vary but I might give this a go for a future loaf to see if it improves the shaping. 

## Ok fine. 

They probably aren’t something that you need to worry about when following a recipe, but it’s good to know what they mean. I’m putting them under “good to know”, as I’m likely to be using scraps of flour in the coming weeks as we run out of baking ingredients, forcing me to use saw dust and bones to make rudimentary flat breads. 

TTFN. 

[^caveat]: This is usually with the caveat that the bread will likely be denser, as less hydration means it loses the ability to rise as much.
