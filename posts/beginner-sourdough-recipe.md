I’ve got to a point with my sourdough now where I can make a half decent loaf. This is the recipe and process I’ve been using. It works for me - maybe it will for you too!

## Ingredients
- 338g strong white flour
- 38g whole wheat flour
- 140g starter (50% flour and water)
- 238g water 
- 9 g salt

### Hydration
The original recipe I took this from was nearer 77% hydration. I found that too wet to shape so I dropped it down:

- Total flour (including starter) - 446g 
- Total water (including starter) - 308g
- 308 / 446 = 69% Hydration

69% (nice) is the magic number for me at the moment. I am gonna gradually increase this as I get better.  

## Method

### Starter

I feed my starter for a few days to fatten it up (usually a table spoon each of water/flour). I then give it a largish feed the day before I want to bake. This feed needs to get it up to the weight you want *plus* enough to keep your starter going for the next loaf. If it’s pretty low, I might top it up with some larger than usual feeds for a few days. 

I want to mix about 5pm so I try and time the feeding so that it’s at it’s maximum bubblyness. I think this depends on the starter, the temperature, what you fed it etc… at the moment it’s quite warm, so 3-4 hours is enough for me. Basically, I want it to at least double in size. 

### Mixing

I add the starter, flours and water into my stand mixer and put it on low for about a minute, just till it’s all combined. I then leave it to autolyse for half an hour to an hour depending on what I’m doing. 

I then add the salt (**DON’T FORGET THE FUCKING SALT!**) and mix on a low setting for 4 mins, then on a higher setting for 3-6 mins until I can do a windowpane test. 

### Bulk ferment/stretch and fold

I take the dough out of the bowl and put it into an (olive) oiled Pyrex dish with a lid. I then stretch it out into a rectangle and fold one end into the middle and then 1 by 1, each side over to its opposite side (that might not make sense, look up a video on stretch and folding dough). Every hour I repeat until it’s had 4 more folds. 

After the last fold, I leave it for another hour. 

### Shaping

Next I tip the dough out onto the worktop and roughly shape it into a round (again a YouTube video is gonna explain it better than I can). I leave that for 15 mins (yes making bread is 90% waiting) and then I shape it ready to go in the bread basket. 

Shaping is dependent on your basket and what you want the bread to look like. A boule is nice and pretty easy to do. I tried a batard this week and it worked. Whatever you fancy. The best part about the  lower hydration dough is that shaping is a lot easier.  

Once it’s shaped I put it into a (heavily
floured) banneton. Cover it with shower caps and put it in the fridge until morning. This is normally 10ish hours. 

### Baking

When I wake up, I get a iron casserole pan, put it in the oven, and turn it on to 250°. Once the oven is up to temp, I get the dough out of the fridge and the pan out of the oven (**the pan is FUCKING HOT)**. I tip the dough onto the counter (usually into some baking paper) and then score the top (YouTube again). Then the dough goes in the pan, lid on and into the oven for 22 mins. 

*One thing I’ve learned is that you need to cook bread longer than you think and usually longer than most recipes say.*

Then I remove the lid from the (still **FUCKING HOT**) pan, turn the heat down to about 220° and give it another 15-25 mins depending on how it’s looking. Once it’s cooked, I put the loaf (without the pan) back into the switched off oven, with the door ajar, for 15 minutes. 

You then need to let it cool down ideally until it’s completely cool but at least 2 hours. This sucks but waiting nearly over.

If you can’t wait cos the kids need lunch and you’re too much of a knob these days to buy a loaf of bread, it’s not the end of the world. It’ll just dry out quicker or go a bit chewy.
